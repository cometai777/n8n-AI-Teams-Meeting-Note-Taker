# n8n-Teams-Meeting-Note-Taker

This workflow automatically manages Microsoft Teams meetings from start to finish, removing the need for manual coordination and note-taking.

First, the system continuously monitors the Outlook calendar to search for newly scheduled meeting events. When a relevant meeting is detected, the workflow automatically accepts the calendar invitation on behalf of the Recall bot, ensuring the bot is properly registered as an attendee before the meeting starts.

At the scheduled meeting time, the Recall bot automatically joins the Microsoft Teams meeting using the meeting’s join URL. The workflow handles timing and access checks to ensure the bot only attempts to join active meetings and avoids duplicate join attempts.

After the meeting ends, the workflow retrieves the meeting transcript generated by Recall. Once the transcript is available, it is processed by an AI agent that analyzes the conversation and generates structured meeting notes, such as a summary, key discussion points, decisions, and action items.

Finally, the generated meeting notes are automatically sent to all meeting attendees through the appropriate communication channel (such as email or Microsoft Teams), ensuring everyone receives accurate and consistent notes shortly after the meeting concludes.

The workflow includes validation, error handling, and logging at each stage to prevent repeated processing, handle permission issues, and provide visibility into skipped or failed meetings.
